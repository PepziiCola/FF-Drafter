# FF-Drafter

This project powers the backend functionality for FF-Drafter and includes shared utilities.

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: Entry point is `backend.js`, executed via Electron.
- **Shared Utilities**: Reusable logic in `shared.js`.
- **Frontend App**: Frontend work for the app
- **Frontend Web**: Frontend work for the website

## Details
This project is going to be rather complex with a lot of working pieces. When I considered doing this project, I looked at other
websites and apps for reference. I took a lot of inspiration from [Flock Fantasy](https://flockfantasy.com/) and ESPN's popular Fantasy app.

There was obviously stuff I looked at and thought to myself, I could do better. To start, this will mainly focus on fantasy for NFL. So here's some features of the plan.
